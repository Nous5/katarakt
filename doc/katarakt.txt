NAME
----
katarakt - a simple PDF viewer with two layouts

SYNOPSIS
--------
*katarakt* ['OPTIONS'] 'FILE'|'URL'

DESCRIPTION
-----------
It's a PDF viewer. It views PDFs.

There are currently two layouts.  The 'presentation layout' is very simple and
only supports scrolling on a per page basis. As the name suggests the current
page is displayed in the center and zoomed to fit the window. It is active by
default.

The 'grid layout' is much more advanced and offers continuous (smooth, per
pixel) scrolling, zooming and adjusting the column count. Pages keep their
correct relative size and are shown in a grid.
