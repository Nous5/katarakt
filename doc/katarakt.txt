NAME
----
katarakt - a simple PDF viewer with three layouts

SYNOPSIS
--------
*katarakt* (['OPTIONS'] 'FILE'|(-u 'URL'))*

DESCRIPTION
-----------
It's a PDF viewer. It views PDFs.

There are currently three layouts. The 'presentation layout' is very simple and
only supports scrolling on a per page basis. As the name suggests the current
page is displayed in the center and zoomed to fit the window. It is active by
default.

The 'grid layout' is much more advanced and offers continuous (smooth, per
pixel) scrolling, zooming and adjusting the column count. Pages keep their
correct relative size and are shown in a grid.

The 'presenter layout' is for giving a presentation. It opens a second window,
to be viewed on the beamer, and shows the current and next slide in the main
window.

For every file passed on the command line a separate process is spawned.

OPTIONS
-------
*-u*, *--url* ::
	Instead of opening a local document, download it from the given URL.
*-p*, *--page* 'NUM' ::
	Start on page 'NUM'.
*-f*, *--fullscreen* ::
	Start in fullscreen mode.
*-q*, *--quit* ::
	Quit on initialization failure.
*-h*, *--help* ::
	Print help and exit.

CONFIGURATION
-------------
Variables and key bindings can be changed by modifying the katarakt.ini file.
By default it is read from '$XDG_CONFIG_HOME'.

Variables must be listed under the section "[Settings]", keys under section
"[Keys]".  For a list of all variables with a short explanation see below.

KEY BINDINGS
------------
*q* ::
	Quit *katarakt*.
*1* ::
	Switch to 'presentation layout'. Views a single page at a time, scaled to
	fit the screen.
*2* ::
	Switch to 'grid layout'. Views pages in a continuous fashion, scaled to fit
	the width. Supports columns.
*3* ::
	Switch to 'presenter layout'. Views the current page and a smaller preview
	of the next page. Also, opens a second window that shows only the current
	page for displaying on a beamer.

*Up*, *Down*, *Left*, *Right*, *k*, *j*, *h*, *l* ::
	Move around (up/down/left/right).
*\^u*, *^d* ::
	Scroll up/down half the screen.
*BackSpace*, *Space*, *\^b*, *^f* ::
	Scroll up/down the screen. By default scrolls 90% to create an overlapping region.
*PgUp*, *PgDown* ::
	Scroll up/down one page. Kind of swaps the pages in place.

*Home*, *End*, *g*, *G* ::
	Go to the first/last page.
*^g* ::
	Show 'goto page' bar.
*f* ::
	Toggle fullscreen.
*t* ::
	Toggle the page number display in the bottom right corner.
*r* ::
	Reload the document. This can also be achieved by sending SIGUSR1 to the
	process. *katarakt* reloads automatically if the opened file has changed.
*o* ::
	Open a different document; shows a file dialog.
*s* ::
	Show a file dialog to save the current document.
*F9* ::

*{*, *}* ::
	Adjust the column the first page will be displayed in. Useful for reading
	in a book layout with a cover page ('grid layout' only).
